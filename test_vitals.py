# ASSIGNMENT 4 — your tests go below this line.
# Same procedure as the lecture slide "Building the test file, step by step":
# names starting with test_, a docstring with the expected value and where
# it came from, and  assert False, "body not written yet"  until the
# bodies are filled in (in a new chat, without vitals.py).
